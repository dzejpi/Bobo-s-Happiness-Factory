Everybody loves treats and gifts from Bobo’s Happiness Family company. Do you have what it takes to become one of the best Bobo’s Happiness Factory workers? We will see about that!

Bobo is very nice to everybody, but if you destroy more than 250 $ items, then you’re off, so be careful!

Gameplay: ~5 minutes.

## How to play?

1. Wait for the item to drop from the conveyor belt to the working area.
1. Click on the item that you want to wrap.
1. Hover above `(+)` marker until the item is fully wrapped.
1. Select another item.

If you want to mute sounds or music in game:
* You can pause the game by pressing Esc.
* When in pause menu, the items disappear, but the game still goes on, so be quick!

## Known issues
Sometimes if you restart the failed game super quickly, you can take some damage right away from the old instances. I tried the best to limit this and it should be very rare, but if you want to go for "high score" and want to be super safe, just restart the game, or check whether you are not taking damage right away. If you are not even after 10 seconds, you’re good to go.
